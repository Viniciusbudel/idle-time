# Atomic Age Background Prompts (3 Layers - Vertical & Framed)

Here are detailed prompts for the "Atomic Age" background, structured for a **vertical 2D mobile game**.

**CRITICAL COMPOSITION RULE:** The center of the image will be covered by game UI. All key visual details, landmarks, and interesting elements must be positioned at the **top, bottom, and side borders**. The center should be relatively empty or atmospheric.

## Option 1: "The Model Town" (Nuketown/Fallout)
**Concept:** A pristine, eerie suburban testing ground overshadowed by a reactor.

**Prompt:**
> A vertical 2D mobile game background asset, split into 3 distinct depth layers for parallax scrolling. **Composition:** Key details are framed around the borders; the center is open sky/atmosphere. **Layer 1 (Background - Top):** A massive, looming industrial nuclear reactor tower rising high into the top third, flanked by a vibrant, radioactive purple and electric cyan sky. **Layer 2 (Middleground - Sides/Bottom):** Rows of pastel-colored 1950s suburban houses lining the left and right edges, leaving the center open. **Layer 3 (Foreground - Bottom):** A detailed white picket fence and a "Welcome to the Future" retro billboard peeling to reveal rust (Fallout style) anchored at the very bottom edge. Cinematic lighting, hyper-detailed borders, atompunk, 4k, --ar 9:16

## Option 2: "The Reactor Core" (Industrial/Bioshock)
**Concept:** Where the power is made. Heavy industrial machinery meets Art Deco.

**Prompt:**
> A vertical 2D mobile game background asset, split into 3 distinct depth layers for parallax scrolling. **Composition:** Frame-focused interaction; center is the reactor chasm. **Layer 1 (Background - Top/Bottom):** Dark industrial ceiling vents and floor grating at the extremes, with a vertical chasm in the center. **Layer 2 (Middleground - Sides):** Massive humming vacuum tube banks and brass pipes running vertically along the far left and right walls, framing the image. **Layer 3 (Foreground - Borders):** Art Deco railings and control panels with "Danger" signs bordering the bottom and sides, creating a "window" effect. Voltage Yellow and Electric Cyan lighting on edges, highly detailed, 8k, --ar 9:16

## Option 3: "The Wasteland Utopia" (Retro-Futurism)
**Concept:** A view of a futuristic atomic city from a distance.

**Prompt:**
> A vertical 2D mobile game background asset, split into 3 distinct depth layers for parallax scrolling. **Composition:** Vertical city canyon; details on top and bottom. **Layer 1 (Background - Top):** A high, hazy, radioactive orange sunset sky with faint wasteland mountains at the very top. **Layer 2 (Middleground - Sides/Top):** Gleaming retro-futuristic skyscrapers (The Jetsons style) towering on the left and right sides, creating a central alley of open air. Flying cars leave neon trails near the top. **Layer 3 (Foreground - Bottom):** A rugged, rocky wasteland terrain with a rusty chain-link fence and yellow "HIGH VOLTAGE" signs anchoring the bottom edge. Matte painting style, vibrant colors, clear depth separation, --ar 9:16

## Option 4: "Nuketown Pixel Art Variation" (Specific Reference)
**Concept:** Based on the user reference image (Rockets, UFOs, Neon Signs, Pixel Art Style).

**Prompt:**
> A vertical 2D pixel art game background asset, split into 3 distinct depth layers for parallax scrolling. **Composition:** Key details pushed to borders to leave center clear for UI. **Layer 1 (Background - Top):** A vibrant orange sunset sky at the top border with retro rockets taking off, flying saucers (UFOs), and distant mushroom cloud smoke plumes. **Layer 2 (Middleground - Sides):** Dense retro-futuristic city buildings rising vertically along the left and right edges, featuring "Atomic Cafe", "Nuka Cola", and "Vault-Tec" neon signs. Massive cooling towers visible in the upper-mid section. **Layer 3 (Foreground - Bottom):** A detailed, wrecked rusty 1950s car, a broken robot, and scattered rubble/barrels with radiation symbols anchoring the bottom edge. High-quality pixel art style, heavy outlines, vibrant colors (orange/cyan contrast), --ar 9:16

## Generation Tips
- **Empty Center:** Ensure the model pushes buildings and objects to the sides (`left and right edges`, `framing the view`).
- **Vertical Hierarchy:** Heavy details at the **Bottom** (Foreground) and **Top** (Sky/Tower), keeping the middle-center clean for gameplay elements.
